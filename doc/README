self-net is a network for control information interation, integriting all systems that belongs to one people or one small entity. 

self-net can integrite:
1. host access by hostname.
2. user/group information. (same as LDAP, but in a fully distributed manner)
3. user configuration synchronization.
4. user home directory synchronization.

self-net limitations:
1. when no router present, self-net is a mesh network, N hosts lead to N! connections.

self-net applications have three types: agent, client, peer.
agent can only communicate with client, peer can only communicate with peer.
applications can communicate with the other half on localhost or remote host.
system applications can only communicate with system applications.
applications of user X can only communicate with applications of user X.





self-net is for controlling only, for example, self-net transmits ssh
keys between hosts so that user can ssh without typing password, but the ssh
packets won't go through self-net.






Different between self-net and gnunet

1. gnunet is for computers to commnunicate in a security manner, self net is to integrite all the systems belongs to one user

2. self-net is a network for control.

3.
