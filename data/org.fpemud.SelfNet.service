# This D-Bus service activation file is only for systemd support since
# an auto-activated selfnetd would be quite surprising for those people
# who have seflnetd installed but turned off.  Thus the Exec path available
# to D-Bus is /bin/false, but systemd knows the real Exec path due to the
# selfnetd systemd .service file.
